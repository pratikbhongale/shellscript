Starting with Bash Scripting 
#!/bin/bash: This is an shebang line which we need to write before we start writing the script 
echo is used to print
ex- echo "Hello World!!"
When creating a variable we can't give spaces before and after the = sign
ex- name="ABC"
We can use nano or vim editor to write a script
vim file.sh or nano file.sh
we have to set permission after the script has been written
chmod +x file.sh #to make the file executable
to run the file we can use following command
./file.sh
bash file.sh
No need to add ; after everyline
if we have 2 var in the file, we can also add the parameters outside script in cli 
./file.sh BOB buddy
To take a user input in bash we use read keyword
ex- echo "What is your name?"
read name #we are storing the value in name variable
echo "Hi $name"
OR
read -p "What's your name?" name
echo "hi $name"
Created a script which displays date, hostname, ls, netstat -tulp, and other basic cmds
we can pass args seperately when executing the file
echo "$1"
echo "$2"
./args.sh cat dog # here we are passing 2 arguments
to print all the args = echo "$@"
Array : we can store element in enclosed () no sepration using ,
and to access the element: echo "${myarray[0]}"
